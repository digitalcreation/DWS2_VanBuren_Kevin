    <div class="intro clear">
        <p>'Computer hardware' is the collection of physical elements that constitutes a computer system. Computer hardware refers to the physical parts or components of a computer such as the monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, hard drive disk (HDD), system unit (graphic cards, sound cards, memory, motherboard and chips), etc. all of which are physical objects that can be touched (known as tangible).[1] In contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware.</p>
        <p>Software is any set of machine-readable instructions that directs a computer's processor to perform specific operations. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content1 section-mobile">
        <h2 class="divider">Von Neumann Architecture</h2>
        <p>The template for all modern computers is the Von Neumann architecture, detailed in a 1945 paper by Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann. This describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with subdivisions of a processing unit consisting of an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers, a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter, a memory to store both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="content1 section-mobile">
        <h2 class="divider">Case</h2>
        <p>The computer case is a plastic or metal enclosure that houses most of the components. Those found on desktop computers are usually small enough to fit under a desk, however in recent years more compact designs have become more common place, such as the all-in-one style designs from Apple, namely the iMac. Laptops are computers that usually come in a clamshell form factor, again however in more recent years deviations from this form factor have started to emerge such as laptops that have a detachable screen that become tablet computers in their own right.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="content1 clear section-mobile section-tablet">
        <h2 class="divider">Personal Computer</h2>
        <p>The personal computer, also known as the PC, is one of the most common types of computer due to its versatility and relatively low price. Laptops are generally very similar, although may use lower-power or reduced size components.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content1 section-mobile section-tablet">
            <h2 class="divider">Power supply</h2>
            <p>A power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage DC power for the internal components of the computer. Laptops are capable of running from a built-in battery, normally for a period of hours.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content1 section-mobile">
        <h2 class="divider">Sales</h2>
        <p>For the third consecutive year, U.S. business-to-business channel sales (sales through distributors and commercial resellers) increased, ending 2013 up nearly 6 percent at $61.7 billion. The impressive growth was the fastest sales increase since the end of the recession. Sales growth accelerated in the second half of the year peaking in fourth quarter with a 6.9 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content1 section-mobile">
            <h2 class="divider">Motherboard</h2>
            <p>The motherboard is the main component of computer. It is a large rectangular board with integrated circuitry that connects the other parts of the computer including the CPU, the RAM, the disk drives(CD, DVD, hard disk, or any others) as well as any peripherals connected via the ports or the expansion slots.</p>
    <div id="mbComponents"></div>

    <div class="content1 section section-mobile">
        <h2 class="divider">Components directly attached to or part of the motherboard include:</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>CPU</th>
                <td>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) performs most of the calculations which enable a computer to function, and is sometimes referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It is usually cooled by a heat sink and fan. Most newer CPUs include an on-die Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>RAM</th>
                <td>The Chipset, which includes the north bridge, mediates communication between the CPU and the other components of the system, including main memory.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            <tr>
                <th>ROM</th>
                <td>The Read-Only Memory (ROM) stores the BIOS that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution, a process known as Bootstrapping, or "booting" or "booting up". The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) includes boot firmware and power management firmware. Newer motherboards use Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) instead of BIOS.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>CMOS</th>
                <td>The CMOS battery is also attached to the motherboard. This battery is the same as a watch battery or a battery for a remote to a car's central locking system. Most batteries are CR2032, which powers the memory for date and time in the BIOS chip.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>BUS</th>
                <td>Buses connect the CPU to various internal components and to expansion cards for graphics and sound.</td>

    <div class="content2 section-mobile">
        <h2 class="divider" id="expCards">Expansion cards</h2>
        <p>The [expansion card] in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard or backplane to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content2 section-mobile">
        <h2 class="divider">Storage devices</h2>
        <p>Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, refers to computer components and recording media that retain digital data. Data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content2 section-mobile section-mobile-clr">
        <h2 class="divider">Fixed media</h2>
        <p>Data is stored by a computer using a variety of media. Hard disk drives are found in virtually all older computers, due to their high capacity and low cost, but solid-state drives are faster and more power efficient, although currently more expensive than hard drives, so are often found in more expensive computers. Some systems may use a disk array controller for greater performance or reliability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content2 section-mobile">
        <h2 class="divider">Removable media</h2>
        <p>To transfer data between computers, a USB flash drive or Optical disc may be used. Their usefulness depends on being readable by other systems; the majority of machines have an optical disk drive, and virtually all have a USB port.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="content2 clear section-mobile">
        <h2 class="divider">Input</h2>
        <p>Input devices allow the user to enter information into the system, or control its operation. Most personal computers have a mouse and keyboard, but laptop systems typically use a touchpad instead of a mouse. Other input devices include webcams, microphones, joysticks, and image scanners.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="content2 section-mobile">
        <h2 class="divider">Mainframe computer</h2>
        <p>A mainframe computer is a much larger computer that typically fills a room and may cost many hundreds or thousands of times as much as a personal computer. They are designed to perform large numbers of calculations for governments and large enterprises.</p>
    <div id="superComputer"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="content2 section section-mobile">
        <h2 class="divider">Supercomputer</h2>
        <p>A supercomputer is superficially similar to a mainframe, but is instead intended for extremely demanding computational tasks. As of November 2013, the fastest supercomputer in the world is the Tianhe-2, in Guangzhou, China.</p>
        <p>The term supercomputer does not refer to a specific technology. Rather it indicates the fastest computers available at any given time. In mid 2011, the fastest supercomputers boasted speeds exceeding one petaflop, or 1000 trillion floating point operations per second. Super computers are fast but extremely costly so they are generally used by large organizations to execute computationally demanding tasks involving large data sets. Super computers typically run military and scientific applications. Although they cost millions of dollars, they are also being used for commercial applications where huge amounts of data must be analyzed. For example, large banks employ supercomputers to calculate the risks and returns of various investment strategies, and healthcare organizations use them to analyze giant databases of patient data to determine optimal treatments for various diseases.</p>
